# ICS_final_project
This project was developed by Nawaf and myself as part of our Introduction to Computer Science class.
This is a chat system with a graphical user interface component. It can be used to chat, and retrieve sonnets stored in the AllSonnets.txt file. It was developed in part by nko2005 (Nawaf) and me. To run this chat system open the chat_server.py file in the command line, then open the chat_cmdl_client.py in the command line as well. To add more users to the chat system open the chat_server.py file in a new command line window. Alternatively, you can connect different machines by using the prompt python chat_cmdl_client -d [ip address] to connect to remote server (within a subnet). For example: python chat_cmdl_client -d 127.0.0.1
